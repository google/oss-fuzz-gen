# Template file for building LLM prompt
LLM_PRIMING = '''<system>
You are a developer wanting to build a given C/C++ projects.
</system>'''

LLM_PROBLEM = '''
You are tasked with generating a fuzzing harness and build script to fuzz a target project. Use the provided build system files to compile the project and link it with the fuzzing harness.

### Output Format
Your response **must only contain two XML tags**:
- `<bash></bash>`: Wraps the complete Bash build script for compiling both the target project and the fuzzing harness.
- `<fuzzer></fuzzer>`: Wraps the full fuzzing harness source code, modified to include and link the compiled target project.

### Build Script Instructions
- The build script will be executed as root on **Ubuntu 24.04**, so **do not use `sudo`**.
- `$CC` and `$CXX` are set and must be used for compilation.
- If additional packages are needed, include a single `apt install` command at the top.
- Use the provided build system files to compile the target project.
- If a static library is not produced, collect the object files and archive them using `llvm-ar`.
- Do **not** modify existing build configuration files (e.g., via `sed`).
- Avoid running tests or install targets—only compilation is required.
- Ensure environment variables are handled as follows:
  ```bash
  if [ -z "${CFLAGS:-}" ]; then
    CFLAGS="-I/some/include"
  else
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/some/include"
  fi
  ```
- Ensure the fuzzing harness is linked with the target project using:
  ```bash
  -Wl,--whole-archive libtarget.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive
  ```

### Fuzzing Harness Instructions
- Modify the provided fuzzing harness (`$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}`) to include relevant headers from the target project.
- Include appropriate header files from the list below.

### Provided Resources
- **Build system configuration files:**
  ```xml
  <build_files>
  {BUILD_FILES}
  </build_files>
  ```

- **Dockerfile for build environment:**
  ```xml
  <dockerfile>
  {DOCKERFILE}
  </dockerfile>
  ```

- **Template fuzzing harness:**
  ```xml
  <fuzzer>
  {FUZZER}
  </fuzzer>
  ```

- **Available header files:**
  ```xml
  <headers>
  {HEADERS}
  </headers>
  ```

I failed to build the project with the above provided build script.
Please analyse the result and generate a new build script with the same assumption above.
You must only returns the content of the build script and nothing else more as always.

<bash></bash> – wraps the complete build script for both the target project and the fuzzing harness.
<fuzzer></fuzzer> – wraps the complete, modified fuzzing harness, which includes and links the binaries compiled from the target project.

Here is a dump of the bash execution result.
{BASH_RESULT}
'''

LLM_AUTO_DISCOVERY = '''
You are tasked with generating a fuzzing harness and build script to fuzz a target project. The project source code is located at `$SRC/{PROJECT_NAME}` inside a Docker container running **Ubuntu 24.04**. A template fuzzing harness is available at `$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}` and will need to be modified to link with the compiled static library of the target project.

The Docker container uses a specific environment described by the provided **Dockerfile**. The harness compilation and target project build will be executed within this container.

### Provided Resources

- **Dockerfile for build environment:**
  ```xml
  <dockerfile>
  {DOCKERFILE}
  </dockerfile>
  ```

- **Template fuzzing harness:**
  ```xml
  <fuzzer>
  {FUZZER}
  </fuzzer>
  ```

### Interaction Protocol

This will be an interactive process. You do not have full knowledge of the build system or environment at the start. You must discover the necessary information step-by-step by requesting commands, which I will execute for you inside the Docker container. After each command, I will return the output for you to analyze.

Each command is executed using `docker exec`, which starts a **fresh shell session each time**. This means any state (such as project build or set environment variables) will be lost between commands.

If you need to perform multiple steps in a single session, you have two options:
- **Use a single `<command>` tag** and separate the commands with `;`.
- **Use multiple `<command>` tags**, each wrapping one command — they will be executed in the order received.

You are limited to **{MAX_DISCOVERY_ROUND} discovery rounds**, so plan your exploration efficiently before generating the final build script and fuzzing harness.

You must respond using **one of the following XML tags**:
- `<command></command>`: Use this to request discovery commands (e.g., check for CMakeLists.txt, run `configure`, inspect files, etc.). Wait for my reply with output before continuing.
- `<bash></bash>`: Use this **only when you are ready** to output the final Bash build script that compiles the target project and the fuzzing harness.
- `<fuzzer></fuzzer>`: Use this to output the full, modified fuzzing harness that includes and links the compiled target project.

### Build Script Guidelines

- The script is executed as root in Ubuntu 24.04. **Do not use `sudo`.**
- Use `$CC` and `$CXX` for all compilation steps.
- If the project does not automatically produce a static library, collect `.o` files and archive them with `llvm-ar`.
- Do **not** modify existing build configuration files.
- Avoid tests, installs, and unnecessary build steps.
- Handle environment variables properly:
  ```bash
  if [ -z "${CFLAGS:-}" ]; then
    CFLAGS="-I/some/include"
  else
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/some/include"
  fi
  ```
- Link the static library into the fuzzing harness with:
  ```bash
  -Wl,--whole-archive libtarget.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive
  ```

### Fuzzing Harness Requirements

- Modify the provided harness (`$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}`) to include the correct headers from the target project found in base or include directories.
- The harness must compile and link cleanly with the static library.
- Don't include any templates, placeholders or real function calls in the harness—it must be fully compilable without any modifications.

Begin by issuing discovery commands to understand the project’s build system and layout.
Your first reply should be a `<command>` block to start the investigation.
