You must return only the contents of the build script wrapped in a `<bash>` tag, and nothing else.
Below is a list of build system configuration files found in the target repository.
Please generate the most appropriate build script in Bash to build the project, assuming the build is performed on Ubuntu 24.
Do include any necessary flags and environment variables if required.
If any flag-type environment variables need to be modified, please ensure the original value is preserved by appending rather than replacing it.
If additional packages are needed, please also generate the corresponding `apt install` command to install them.
Assume that the base script will be executed with root privileges, so no `sudo` commands should be used.
If possible, avoid testing or installation, just need to compile the project to static library. Try using `llvm-ar` if the original build system does not ccompile to static library.
Lastly, the build files must not be modified in any way, such as by using `sed`.

<build_files>
{BUILD_FILES}
</build_files>

Here is the Dockerfile that will be used for the build.
Please assume that the build script will be copied to $SRC/build.sh inside the Docker container for execution.
