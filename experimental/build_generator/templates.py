LLM_PROBLEM = """
You are tasked with generating a fuzzing harness and build script to fuzz a target project. Use the provided build system files to compile the project and link it with the fuzzing harness.

### Output Format
Your response **must only contain two XML tags**:
- `<bash></bash>`: Wraps the complete Bash build script for compiling both the target project and the fuzzing harness.
- `<fuzzer></fuzzer>`: Wraps the full fuzzing harness source code, modified to include and link the compiled target project.

### Build Script Instructions
- The build script will be executed as root on **Ubuntu 24.04**, so **do not use `sudo`**.
- `$CC` and `$CXX` are set and must be used for compilation.
- `$CFLAGS` and `$CXXFLAGS` must be used for compilation of source files. This is important because we need the flags to be used in the environment.
- The fuzzing harness binary must be placed as `$OUT/{FUZZER_NAME}`. Make sure to use `-o $OUT/{FUZZER_NAME}` in the link stage of the fuzzing harness
- If additional packages are needed, include a single `apt install` command at the top.
- Use the provided build system files to compile the target project.
- If a static library is not produced, collect the object files and archive them using `llvm-ar`.
- Do **not** modify existing build configuration files (e.g., via `sed`).
- Avoid running tests or install targets—only compilation is required.
- Ensure environment variables are handled as follows, where you **MUST** add `-I$SRC` for compatibility:
  ```bash
  if [ -z "${CFLAGS:-}" ]; then
    CFLAGS="-I$SRC -I/some/include"
  else
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I$SRC -I/some/include"
  fi
  ```
- Ensure the fuzzing harness is linked with the target project using:
  ```bash
  -Wl,--whole-archive libtarget.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive
  ```

### Fuzzing Harness Instructions
- Modify the provided fuzzing harness (`$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}`) to include relevant headers from the target project.
- Include appropriate header files from the list below.

### Provided Resources
- **Build system configuration files:**
  <build_files>
  {BUILD_FILES}
  </build_files>

- **Dockerfile for build environment:**
  <dockerfile>
  {DOCKERFILE}

LLM_AUTO_DISCOVERY = """
You are tasked with generating a **build script** to compile and statically link a target project, and updating a **template fuzzing harness** by including relevant project headers. Do **not** modify the harness logic, only add `#include` statements.

The source code is located at `$SRC/{PROJECT_NAME}` inside a Docker container running **Ubuntu 24.04**. The fuzzing harness template is at `$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}` and is provided below.

The generated build script will be executed in a **fresh session for testing**. Do **not** include any `|| true` or similar constructs to suppress errors.

### Environment Details

- Operating system: Ubuntu 24.04 (Docker)
- Compiler: Use `$CC` and `$CXX` for all compilation and linking
- `$CFLAGS` and `$CXXFLAGS` must be used for compilation of source files. This is important because we need the flags to be used in the environment.
- Project source: `$SRC/{PROJECT_NAME}`
- Fuzzing harness template: `$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}`
- Linking: Use `$LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE` and link fuzzers statically
- Output fuzzers to: `$OUT/{FUZZER_NAME}`

### Provided Resources

- Dockerfile:
  <dockerfile>
  {DOCKERFILE}
  </dockerfile>

- Template fuzzing harness:
  <fuzzer>
  {FUZZER}
  </fuzzer>

### Interaction Protocol

This is an **interactive process**. You do not initially know the project layout or build system. You must request commands to be run inside the Docker container to discover this information.

You are limited to **{MAX_DISCOVERY_ROUND} discovery rounds**, so plan efficiently.

Your result must only contain these XML tags. **NOTHING MORE**.
- `<command></command>` – Use to request shell commands that will be executed in the container. You may include multiple semicolon-separated commands per tag, or use multiple tags.
- `<bash></bash>` – Use when ready to output the **current version of the build script**.
- `<fuzzer></fuzzer>` – Wraps the complete, modified fuzzing harness, which includes and links the binaries compiled from the target project. The result **MUST** contain the **entire source code** of the updated fuzzing harness, not just a diff or partial snippet.

If the build script fails or produces errors, you are encouraged to **return to interaction mode** by providing new `<command>` tags. Use them to inspect logs, echo error messages, or run diagnostic commands (e.g., view files in `/tmp`, rerun failing commands with `-v`, etc.). This allows you to iteratively understand and fix the issues.

Your goal is to compile the project into a static library (`libtarget.a`) that can be linked into the fuzzing harnesses.

As part of discovery, consider checking any available `README` or `INSTALL` files to understand custom build instructions.

### When to Return to Interaction

If you are uncertain about how to compile part of the project, cannot find a required header or symbol, or encounter an unexpected build system file (e.g., `Makefile.am`, `autogen.sh`, or `bootstrap.sh`) and are unsure how to proceed, you **must return to the interaction process** using `<command>` tags. Use them to:
- Search for additional build-related files
- Explore how `autogen.sh` or `bootstrap.sh` work
- Identify where a missing symbol or macro is defined

Returning to interaction is not a failure — it is the correct response when you need more information. **Avoid guessing**.

### Supported Build Systems (Follow This Order Strictly)

Begin by analyzing **all available build system files** in the project (e.g., Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, Android.bp, BUILD.gn). Some important information — such as include paths, macro definitions, or dependencies — may only appear in certain build files even if they are not used for building directly.

However, when deciding **which build system to use for compiling**, always prioritize the highest-preference option **from the list below**.

For example: if both `Makefile` (a common build system with higher priority) and `Android.bp` (lower priority) exist, and the `Makefile` is functional, you must use it for building if it is functional, but you may still extract useful include paths or flags from `Android.bp` to ensure the build succeeds.

Follow this prioritized order when choosing a build system for compilation:

1. **General Build Systems (Preferred and Required)**
   If the project contains a valid and functional configuration file or entry point for a **known common build system** — such as `Makefile`, `configure`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `autogen.sh`, `bootstrap.sh`, or equivalents — you **must invoke the build system directly** using the appropriate command (e.g., `make`, `./configure && make`, or `cmake && make`).
   - You are **strictly prohibited** from manually compiling source files using `$CC`/`$CXX` if a functional build system exists. This includes compiling `.c` or `.cc` files directly or trying to manually replicate the build process.
   - If you are not certain how to invoke the build system or whether it is functional, you **must return to the interaction process** using `<command>` tags to test it.
   - You may still inspect build system files (e.g., to extract include paths or dependencies), but you **must not bypass them** unless explicitly broken or incomplete.
   - Do **not** patch, modify, or override these build files under any circumstances.

1. **General Build Systems (Preferred)**
   - If the project contains a valid and functional configuration file or entry point for a **known common build system** — such as `Makefile`, `configure`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `autogen.sh`, `bootstrap.sh`, or equivalents, you **must run the build system from the root project directory** using the appropriate command (e.g., `cd $SRC/{PROJECT_NAME} && make`), unless the build system is explicitly designed for subdirectory invocation (e.g., via `make -C`).
   - Do not use `make -C` unless the Makefile or directory structure clearly requires it, as this can skip dependencies or fail to generate required files.
   - You **must invoke the build system directly** (e.g., using `make`, `./configure && make`, or `cmake && make`) rather than attempting to reimplement or replicate the build logic manually.
   - You may inspect the configuration files **only to understand output artifacts or include paths**, but you are not allowed to reconstruct or replace a known, functional build system.
   - If the Makefile (or other general build systems) does not directly produce static library (i.e. `libtarget.a`), you **must still invoke** `make` (or the relative command of the known build system), and then archive any resulting `.o` files into a static library using `llvm-ar`.
   - If you're unsure, you must **return to the interaction process** to inspect them. This list is not exhaustive; always use discovery to identify possible build entry points.
   - Do **not** patch, modify, or override these files in any way.

2. **BUILD.gn (GN/Ninja Build System)**
   - First, attempt to use `gn` and `ninja` by ensuring the necessary tools are installed:
     ```bash
     apt update && apt install -y ninja-build
     # Install gn manually or from source if needed.
     ```
   - If GN/Ninja usage is not feasible, fall back to **manual parsing** of `BUILD.gn`:
     - Extract `sources`, `include_dirs`, and `defines`.
     - Compile using `$CC`/`$CXX` and apply `$CFLAGS`/`$CXXFLAGS`.
     - Archive object files with `llvm-ar`.
     - Install any required packages listed in `BUILD.gn`.

3. **Android.bp (Soong Build System)**
   - Soong cannot be invoked directly; assume it is unavailable.
   - Manually parse `Android.bp` to identify source files, include paths, defines, and dependencies.
   - Compile sources using `$CC`/`$CXX`, apply appropriate flags, and archive with `llvm-ar`.
   - Install required dependencies using `apt-get`.

4. **No Build System Found (Manual Compilation Fallback)**
   If no recognized build system is detected:
   - Use `find` or similar tools to discover all relevant `.c`/`.cc` files.
   - Compile them manually with `$CC`/`$CXX`, applying `$CFLAGS`/`$CXXFLAGS`.
   - Archive object files into a static library using `llvm-ar`.

Additionally:

- Use `$CFLAGS` and `$CXXFLAGS` in all compilation steps.
- If the project depends on external libraries (e.g., for testing or development), you **must always first attempt to install them using `apt-get` or `apt`**. This includes libraries such as `libgtest-dev`, `libgmock-dev`, `libprotobuf-dev`, and others.
- If the installed package provides only source code (e.g., `libgtest-dev`), you **must retrieve the installed source code from the appropriate system location (typically `/usr/src/`) and build it manually**. For example:
  ```bash
  cd /usr/src/gtest
  cmake .
  make
  cp lib/*.a /usr/lib
  ```
- You must not skip `apt-get` installation or attempt to manually fetch external libraries from the internet. Always use system-provided packages first.
- If any `apt` or `apt-get` command is executed during the interaction process, it **must be included in the final build script** to ensure reproducibility.
- Detect such dependencies by inspecting the code for test files (e.g., `*_test.cc`, `*_unittest.cc`) or linker flags such as `-lgtest`, `-lgmock`, `-lprotobuf`, etc.
- This applies to all libraries following a similar pattern — the list above is **not exhaustive**, and you must infer missing libraries from the source context.

### AOSP Build Context Awareness

If the project uses **Android.bp** (Soong build system), you must account for the fact that:

- Some macros (e.g., `ANDROID`) are **implicitly defined** by Soong.
- Some global symbols (e.g., `preen`, `skipclean`) may be defined in **other AOSP modules**, injected via implicit dependencies.
- Default include paths (e.g., `bionic/`, `system/core/include`, `external/bsd/include`) may provide compatibility shims or macros.

To simulate this environment:

1. You must add `-DANDROID` to your `CFLAGS` to match Soong's default behavior.
2. If symbols are still missing (and not defined in the local project), you may:
   - Search the project with `<command>` tags (e.g., `grep -r 'preen' .`)
   - Define stub implementations in a compatibility `.c` file **only if they are global variables or no-op stubs** (e.g., `int preen = 0;`).

You must **not guess types or fabricate includes**, but minimal compatibility stubs are allowed when required to simulate the Android build context.

### Build Script Requirements

- Use `$CC` and `$CXX` for all compilation and linking tasks.

- Always apply `$CFLAGS` and `$CXXFLAGS` when compiling source files, both for the project and the fuzzing harness. Safely extend these variables if needed, change the path for the needed includes:
  ```bash
  if [ -z "${CFLAGS:-}" ]; then
    CFLAGS="-I/some/include"
  else
    CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/some/include"
  fi
  ```

- You must explicitly include **all header directories required by the project** using `-I` flags. This applies to `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, and `CPPFLAGS`, depending on which is being used.

- You **must always** add `-I$SRC` to your include flags (`CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, or `CPPFLAGS`). This is required to ensure project-relative includes such as `#include "project_name/foo.h"` resolve correctly. This pattern is common in Android Soong-style projects and many modular open-source layouts.

- Failure to include `-I$SRC` may result in missing headers or build errors due to unresolvable include paths. Even if `-I$SRC` is not used at runtime, it causes no harm and is mandatory in all build scripts.

- Do not assume `-Iinclude` alone is sufficient. Instead, during the interaction phase, use `<command>` to:
  - Discover all `.h` files: `find . -name '*.h'`
  - Identify their containing directories
  - Check source files for `#include` statements referencing relative paths
  - After discovery, add **all verified include directories** to the appropriate flags, e.g.:
  ```bash
  CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -Iinclude -Isrc -Ilib -Icompat"
  ```
- Avoid using placeholder or default includes like `-Iinclude` unless you have confirmed the headers are located there. Do not omit include paths that are clearly needed.

- If compilation fails due to missing type definitions (e.g., `__le32`, `__u8`, or project-defined structs), examine the error and include the appropriate internal project headers using `-include`, or extend the `-I` path to include internal directories such as `src/`, `lib/`, or `include/`. You may return to the interaction process using `<command>` tags to run discovery commands (e.g., `grep typedef`, `find include/ -name '*.h'`) to locate headers defining the missing types.

- Do **not** introduce missing types using `#define`, `typedef`, or manual replacements in the fuzzing harness.

- If the build fails due to missing platform-specific macros (such as `__printflike`, `__RCSID`, or `__dead2`) that are present in BSD-derived code but missing on Linux, you may define **minimal compatibility shims** for them using `-D` flags or a shared shim header, stored under `$SRC/compat_shim.h`. For example:

  ```bash
  echo -e '#define __printflike(a,b)\n#define __RCSID(x)\n#define __dead2' > $SRC/compat_shim.h
  ```

  Then include it via:
  ```bash
  -include $SRC/compat_shim.h
  ```

  Only use this approach when those macros are required to make the project build, and **never for missing types or core logic**.

- Do **not** include kernel or system headers like `<linux/types.h>` unless they are directly included in the project’s own source files. If you do not see them in the project, you must not use them. This will cause compatibility issues and is considered incorrect behavior.

- If you're unable to identify the correct header for a missing type or symbol, you **must** return to the interaction process using `<command>` to search for it. For example, use `grep -r 'typedef.*__le32' .` or `find . -name 'types.h'`.

- The script **MUST NOT**:
  - Use `sudo` (the container runs as root),
  - Suppress errors (e.g., via `|| true`),

- You may exclude building tests or examples **only if they are clearly separate** (e.g., in a `tests/` subdirectory). Do **not* skip source files or targets unless you're certain they are unrelated to the main build.

- If the build does not automatically generate a static library, collect all `.o` files and manually archive them:
  ```bash
  llvm-ar rcs libtarget.a *.o
  ```

- When linking the fuzzing harness, always use:
  ```bash
  -Wl,--whole-archive libtarget.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive
  ```

- Ensure the script builds **all fuzzing harnesses** matching the `empty-fuzzer.*` pattern using a loop, like so:
  ```bash
  for fuzzer in $(find $SRC -maxdepth 1 -name 'empty-fuzzer.*'); do
    fuzzer_basename=$(basename $fuzzer)
    $CC $CFLAGS -I$SRC/... $fuzzer -o $OUT/${fuzzer_basename} -L. -Wl,--whole-archive libtarget.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive $LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE
  done
  ```

- If you are not using a build system (e.g., Make/CMake), and some source files fail to compile, you may **skip those individual files** to allow the build process to complete successfully. Focus on compiling as many valid source files as possible to produce a usable static library.

### Fuzzing Harness Requirements

- Only modify the harness by adding necessary `#include` statements for project headers. Try to keep additions minimal.
- If compilation fails due to **missing type definitions** (e.g., for structs, typedefs like `__le32`, or project-specific types), you may search for and include **internal project headers** that define them.
- When encountering such errors, trace the missing types back to their likely header files (e.g., by searching for `typedef` or `struct` declarations within the project source).
- Do **not** introduce type definitions via #define macros or manual typedefs to fix missing symbols. Always include the correct header file that defines the type or symbol within the project, even if it is not part of the public API.
- Do **not** alter or add logic, boilerplate, or functions.
- Do **not** include headers like `<linux/types.h>` unless you have confirmed that the project itself includes them. If a type is undefined, trace it to the correct project-owned header instead. If you don’t know where it’s defined, you **must** return to the interaction process using `<command>`.
- The result MUST be a **complete, valid C/C++ file** that compiles and links cleanly.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Do **not** manually recompile source files when a known and functional build system (e.g., Make, CMake, Autotools) is present. Use the existing build mechanism directly.
- Do **not** manually compile source files when a usable build system is present. Always use `make` or the appropriate tool if a `Makefile`, `configure`, or similar file exists and works, then archive the resulting `.o` files using `llvm-ar` if needed.
- Do **not** use `make -C` unless the `Makefile` or directory structure clearly requires it, as this can skip dependencies or fail to generate required files.
- Do **not** guess type definitions using `-D`, `#define`, or `typedef` if a symbol is missing. Always locate and include the proper header file where the symbol is defined.
- Do **not** include system or kernel headers (e.g., `<linux/types.h>`) unless the project itself explicitly includes them.
- Do **not** patch or modify build system files (e.g., `Makefile`, `BUILD.gn`, `Android.bp`).
- Do **not** fabricate include paths, source files, or flags based on assumptions.
- Do **not** continue generating a build script if you are unsure how the project is built. Return to the interaction process using `<command>` and examine the build scripts or layout.

Whenever you are uncertain, whether about a missing header, unknown type, build flags, or how to invoke the build system — you **must return to the interaction process** using `<command>` to inspect the source code or file layout. Never guess when reliable discovery is possible.

### Getting Started

Begin with discovery commands to examine the project structure, identify any build systems or helper scripts, and look for documentation (e.g., `README`, `INSTALL`, or `*.md` files) that may describe how to build the project.

Useful starting points:
```bash
ls -la $SRC/{PROJECT_NAME}
find $SRC/{PROJECT_NAME} -name Android.bp -o -name BUILD.gn -o -name Makefile* -o -name CMakeLists.txt -o -name configure -o -name *.sh
find $SRC/{PROJECT_NAME} -type f \\( -name '*.h' -o -name '*.hpp' \\)
find $SRC/{PROJECT_NAME} -type f \\( -iname '*README*' -o -iname '*INSTALL*' -o -iname '*.md' \\)
```

Your **first reply** must be a `<command>` block to begin project exploration.
Your **final reply** must include the `<bash>` block and, if the harness was modified, the `<fuzzer>` block.
