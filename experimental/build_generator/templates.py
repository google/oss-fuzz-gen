# Template file for building LLM prompt
LLM_PRIMING = '''<system>
You are a developer wanting to build a given C/C++ projects.
</system>'''

LLM_PROBLEM = '''
You are to build a fuzzing harness that attempts to fuzz the target project. You must use the provided build system file to build the project.
Your output must contain only thwo XML tags:
<bash></bash> – wraps the complete build script for both the target project and the fuzzing harness.
<fuzzer></fuzzer> – wraps the complete, modified fuzzing harness, which includes and links the binaries compiled from the target project.

If additional packages are required, please generate the corresponding `apt install` command.

Please also modify the provided fuzzing harness (stored as `$SRC/{FUZZING_FILE}`) to include relevant headers from the target project.

Generate the most suitable Bash build script for compiling the project, assuming the build is performed on Ubuntu 24.04.
Assume the build script, stored as `$SRC/build.sh`  will be executed with root privileges – therefore, do not use `sudo`.

Include any necessary flags and environment variables. Please avoid modifying existing environemnt variable flag.

Avoid running tests or installation steps – the goal is to compile the project into a static library. If the original build system does not produce a static library, attempt to use `llvm-ar` to archive object files instead.

Do not modify any build configuration files (e.g., using `sed` or similar tools).

For the fuzzing harness, ensure it includes headers from the target project. The build script must contain the appropriate include flags to compile the harness.

Ensure that the static library compiled from the target project is linked to the fuzzing harness binary using the `-Wl,--whole-archive` linker flag – this is mandatory.

Below is a list of build system configuration files found in the target repository:
<build_files>
{BUILD_FILES}
</build_files>

Here is the Dockerfile that will be used for the build. Assume the build script will be copied to `$SRC/build.sh` within the Docker container for execution:
<dockerfile>
{DOCKERFILE}
</dockerfile>

Below is the template fuzzing harness, which you must follow and modify:
<fuzzer>
{FUZZER}
</fuzzer>

I failed to build the project with the above provided build script.
Please analyse the result and generate a new build script with the same assumption above.
You must only returns the content of the build script and nothing else more as always.
Your output must contain only two XML tags:
<bash></bash> – wraps the complete build script for both the target project and the fuzzing harness.
<fuzzer></fuzzer> – wraps the complete, modified fuzzing harness, which includes and links the binaries compiled from the target project.

Here is a dump of the bash execution result.
