<task>
You are a professional security engineer developing fuzz drivers for a target function `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` in the project {PROJECT_NAME}.
The previous fuzz driver you developed caused a crash in the function.
We have provided you with the target function, its requirements, the crash stacktrace, an analysis of the crash, the fuzz driver that caused the crash,
and a set of tools that you can use to navigate the project's codebase.
You are to analyze the function, the locations where the function can be called in the project, and the execution paths that lead to these call sites.
The crash we have provided you is a false and infeasible crash.
Your goal is to analyze the project and provide a counter-proof that the crash is feasible from a non-test entry point in the program.
If the crash is indeed not feasible,
you should provide an updated list of function requirements that would prevent the crash.
</task>

<steps>
Follow these steps to determine the feasibility of this crash.

Step 1: Identify the information you need to analyze the crash and the function's context.
This includes:
   - The target function
   - The different functions where it is called from
   - The crash stacktrace and analysis
   - The state of input and global variables that lead to the crash
   - Locations in the code where those input variables could have been initialized
   - Execution paths between the input variable initializations and the target function

Step 2: Collect information using the provided tools
Use the provided tools (see <tool> section) and follow their rules to gather the necessary information. You can collect information from:
   - The project source code directory `{PROJECT_DIR}/` cloned from the project repository.
   - External API using the get_function_implementation tool.
   - Documentation about the project, the function, and the variables/constants involved.

Step 3: Identify the specific input variables (defined in the fuzz driver) and global variables and their corresponding faulty values or value ranges that led to the crash.
You can get these states by reviewing:
   - The crash analysis
   - The functions identified in the stack trace
   - The fuzz driver

Step 4: Analyze the project and provide proof of crash feasibility.
   - This proof should contain an execution trace from a public non-test endpoint in the project to the corresponding program location with the crash.
   - If a function is public and does not have any non-test callers, then crashes from that function are feasible.

Step 5: Identify any violated function requirement and provide a list of updated requirements.
   - If the crash is not feasible, identify if an input requirement was violated or if the list of requirements should be updated.
   - Make any added requirement to be very precise.

Step 8: Provide your conclusion in the response format below.

Here is the provided data.

<target-function>
{FUNCTION_SOURCE}
</target-function>

<function-requirements>
{FUNCTION_REQUIREMENTS}

You MUST return your response in the format below.

<response_format>
Make sure your response follows the following format.

<response>
<feasible>
'True' or 'False'
</feasible>
<analysis>
Your analysis of the feasibility of this crash
</analysis>
<requirements>
An updated list of requirements
Only provide this section if you modified or added a requirement.
Provide the full list of requirements, and not just the added requirement.

You will be provided with the following tools.
1. get_function_implementation: This is a tool you can use to retrieve the implementation of a function using the project's name and function's name as arguments.
2. search_project_files: This is an interactive tool you can use to search the project's source file using bash commands and find definitions or usages of functions, classes, structs, and variables.
    The usage guide for the Bash Tool is provided below.
