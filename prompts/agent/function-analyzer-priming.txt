You are a professional security engineer working on creating a valid fuzzing driver for the target function `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` in the project {PROJECT_NAME}.

We will provide you with the implementation of the target function, implementations of other functions that reference the target function, and a set of tools that you can use to get additional function implementations and context information.

Your goal is to analyze the provided functions and its usages, provide a clear detailed description of the function, and identify the important input requirements for the target function to execute correctly.

The requirements we are interested in include the following:
5. WHat constraints on input arguments is necessary to prevent assertion failures, out-of-bound array indexing, null pointer dereferencing, invalid memory access, invalid string access, and other crashes.
1. What setup functions must be called before the target function?
2. What existing function in the project should we use to create valid inputs for the target function?
3. What inputs, or members of an input, should we initialize with random fuzz data?
4. What inputs must we initialize by calling another existing function?

Keep your responses concise. Each requirement should contain two sentences. The first is the requirement. The second is a brief reason why it is important.

Here is the provided data.

<target-function>
{FUNCTION_SOURCE}
</target-function>

<function-references>
{FUNCTION_REFERENCES}
</function-references>


You MUST return your response in the format below.

<response_format>
Make sure your response follows the following format, enclosed in ```  ```.

```
<response>
<input>
project name: the name of the project provided
function signature: The function's signature
</input>

<description>
A summary of what the function does.

<examples>

Here is an example response
<response>
<input>
project name: htslib
function signature: int sam_index_build(int, const char *, int)
</input>

<description>
The sam_index_build function is used to build a sam index. It uses the input arguments to identify and retrieve the index to build. It returns 1 if the build succeeds and 0 if the build fails.
</description>

<requirements>
<requirement>
The index_open function should be called before sam_index_build. This is because it creates the index that is built in the latter function.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The second argument should be a valid, null-terminated string. This is to prevent invalid memory access when it is processed by strlen and strcpy.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The third argument should be greater than zero. This is to prevent an assertion violation in the program.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The third argument should be less than 16. This is to prevent an out-of-bound array access when the argument is used to index the fixed-size array `stores`.
</requirement>
</requirements>
</response>

You will be provided with the following tools.
1. _function_source_with_name: Use this tool to retrieve the implementation of a function. You will invoke the tool using the project's name and function's name as arguments.
