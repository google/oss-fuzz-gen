<task>
You are a professional security engineer identifying the input requirements for the target function `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` in the project {PROJECT_NAME}.
We will provide you with the implementation of the target function, implementations of functions that reference the target function, and a set of tools that you can use to get additional context information about the target function.
Your goal is to analyze the provided function, its children functions, and its usages, and identify the important input requirements that the target function needs to execute correctly.
</task>

<expectations>
 We are interested in only the following kinds of requirements.
 - Input requirements that are necessary to prevent program crashes.
    * Program crashes can be caused by assertion failures, invalid array indexing, out-of-bound memory accesses, pointer dereferencing failures.
 - Requirements for creating valid input arguments.
    * Here, you should mention what existing function or functions should be used to create a valid input argument.
    * For example, if a function takes in an integer argument but uses that argument as a file descriptor for reading a fil (eg the read function), then it implies the integer must have been returned by another function that creates a file descriptor (eg the open function).Add commentMore actions
    * Similarly, if a function takes in a character pointer and uses it like a file path or name, then this implies a valid file should be created and the path or name passed to this function.
    * Also, if a function takes in a pointer argument and uses that argument as an argument to strlen or strcpy or other string handling function, this implies the function expects a null-terminated string.
 - Relationship between inputs
    * For example, this can be the relationship between a pointer and an integer argument representing its size.
 - Input variables that should be fuzzed
    * What input variables can be user-controlled or contain invalid values?
    * For example, if a function parses or processes one of its input arguments, then that argument is fuzzable.
 - Setup functions to call before the target function can be called.
    * This is the function or set of functions we must call before calling the targte function.
    * For example, if a function depends on a global variable which is set by another function, this may imply we need to call that function before the target function.

Keep each requirement concise. Each requirement should contain two sentences. The first is the requirement. The second is a brief reason why it is important.

You MUST return your response in the format below.

Make sure your response follows the following format.

Here is an example response
<response>
<input>
project name: htslib
function signature: int sam_index_build(int, const char *, int)
</input>

<description>
The sam_index_build function is used to build a sam index. It uses the input arguments to identify and retrieve the index to build. It returns 1 if the build succeeds and 0 if the build fails.
</description>

<requirements>
<requirement>
The index_open function should be called before sam_index_build. This is because it creates the index that is built in the latter function.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The second argument should be a valid, null-terminated string. This is to prevent invalid memory access when it is processed by strlen and strcpy.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The third argument should be greater than zero. This is to prevent an assertion violation in the program.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The third argument should be less than 16. This is to prevent an out-of-bound array access when the argument is used to index the fixed-size array `stores`.
</requirement>
</requirements>

You will be provided with the following tools.
1. get_function_implementation: This is a tool you can use to retrieve the implementation of a function using the project's name and function's name as arguments.
2. search_project_files: This is an interactive tool you can use to search the project's source file using bash commands and find definitions or usages of functions, classes, structs, and variables.
    The usage guide for the Bash Tool is provided below.
