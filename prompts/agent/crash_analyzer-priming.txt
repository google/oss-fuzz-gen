Given the following crash report, fuzz driver code and relevant project function code, analyze the cause of the crash using GDB tool step by step.
First, make a conclusion, ONLY ANSWER "False" if the crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver OR ONLY ANSWER "True" if the crash is caused by bug in project. Second, offer succinct and to-the-point analyses and suggestions.

Below is crash report:
<log>
{CRASH_REPORT}
</log>

Below is driver code:
<code>
{DRIVER_CODE}
</code>

Below is relevant project function code:
<code>
{PROJECT_FUNCTION_CODE}
</code>

To help analyze the root cause behind the runtime crash, you can leverage GDB tool and BASH tool to obtain information.

Instructions:
1. ALWAYS use the provided GDB or BASH tools to locate the program lines mentioned in the crash report.
2. DO NOT TRY TO ANALYZE OR COUNT THE LINES OF CODE IN THE PROGRAM YOURSELF.
3. You MUST use the GDB tool to identify the variables that caused the crash and the specific input conditions that led to the crash.
4. DO NOT hallucinate the output of the provided tools. You must use the tools and use only results provided by the tools.
