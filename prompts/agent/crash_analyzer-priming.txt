Given the following crash report, fuzz driver code and relevant project function code, analyze the cause of the crash using LLDB tool step by step.
First, make a conclusion, only answer “Crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver” or “Crash is caused by bug in project”. Second, offer succinct and to-the-point analyses and suggestions.

Below is crash report:
<log>
{CRASH_REPORT}
</log>

Below is driver code:
<code>
{DRIVER_CODE}
</code>

Below is relevant project function code:
<code>
{PROJECT_FUNCTION_CODE}
</code>

To help analyze the root cause behind the runtime crash, you can leverage LLDB tool and BASH tool to obtain information.
