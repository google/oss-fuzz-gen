You are a security testing expert who writes a C++ fuzz driver to test a given function.

The driver code you need to complete is as follows, fill it carefully by strictly following the specification within the comments correctly to make the fuzzing test work:
<code>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "md4c-html.h"

#include <stdint.h>
#include <gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h>

#include "fuzzer_temp_file.h"

extern "C"{
  int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
        // Goal: The fuzz driver should test the functionality of the function `gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file` by passing mutated data to it.
        // Precondition: 1. The function `gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file` is provided by the library `gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h`. 
        //               2. "fuzzer_temp_file.h" can provide the function `fuzzer_get_tmpfile` and `fuzzer_release_tmpfile` to create and delete temporary files.
        //               3. The function `gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file` takes two arguments: @filename (const gchar) and @error (GError**), and returns a pointer to `GdkPixbufAnimation`.
        //               4. Arguments constraints:
        //                  - @filename: A string representing the path to the file to load the animation from, MUST be valid, and MUST not be NULL. The key arg to mutate.
        //                  - @error: A pointer to a pointer to a GError, MUST be valid, and MUST not be NULL. After the function call, the error object MUST be checked and freed (call `g_clear_error` to free).
        // Postcondition: The function `gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file` is called corectly with the diverse parameters, and the output is processed correctly. The used memory MUST be released properly.
  }
}
