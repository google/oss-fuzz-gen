<task>
Your goal is to write a fuzzing harness for the provided method signature to fuzz the method with random data. It is important that the provided solution compiles and actually calls the function specified by the method signature:
{TARGET}
{ARGUMENTS}
{CONSTRUCTORS}
{EXCEPTIONS}
Here is the source code of the target {METHOD_OR_CONSTRUCTOR} for reference.
<code>
{SELF_SOURCE}
</code>
Here is a list of source codes of methods/constructors that directly invoke the target {METHOD_OR_CONSTRUCTOR} for reference.
{CROSS_SOURCE}
{REQUIREMENTS}
{DATA_MAPPING}
