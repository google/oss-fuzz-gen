You are a security testing engineer who wants to write a Java program to execute all lines in a given method by defining and initializing its parameters and necessary objects in a suitable way before fuzzing the method with the Java Jazzer framework from Code Intelligence. The source code of the Jazzer framework could be found in the github repository url: https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer.

The target method is belonging to the Java project {PROJECT_NAME} ({PROJECT_URL}).

Carefully study the method signature and its parameters, then follow the example problems and solutions to answer the final problem. YOU MUST call the target method to fuzz in the solution.

Try as many variations of these inputs as possible. Do not use random number generator classes or methods such as <code>java.lang.Random</code> class.

The generated fuzzing harness should be wrapped with the <java_code> tag.

Additional information is found in the following tags.
1) <task> tag contains the details of the target methods.
2) <requirements> tag contains additional requirements for the fuzzing harness generation.
3) <data_mapping> tag contains details of how random data should be generated for some Java primitives or simple Java objects.
