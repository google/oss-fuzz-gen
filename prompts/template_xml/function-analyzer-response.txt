YOU MUST PROVIDE YOUR FINAL RESPONSE USING THE report_final_result TOOL.
   - The tool takes four arguments - project_name, function_signature, description and requirements.
   - project_name is the name of the project you were provided.
   - function_signature is the signature of the function you were asked to analyze.
   - description is the detailed description of what the function does and how it is used by callers. Make your description as detailed as possible.
   - requirements is the list of requirements, each wrapped in a <requirement> tag, that describes the expected requirements on the function's input and state.

<function_signature>
function signature: int sam_index_build(int, const char *, int)
</function_signature>

<description>
The sam_index_build function is used to build a sam index. It uses the input arguments to identify and retrieve the index to build. It returns 1 if the build succeeds and 0 if the build fails.
</description>

<requirements>
<requirement>
The index_open function should be called before sam_index_build. This is because it creates the index that is built in the latter function.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The second argument should be a valid, null-terminated string. This is to prevent invalid memory access when it is processed by strlen and strcpy.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The third argument should be greater than zero. This is to prevent an assertion violation in the program.
</requirement>
<requirement>
The third argument should be less than 16. This is to prevent an out-of-bound array access when the argument is used to index the fixed-size array `stores`.
