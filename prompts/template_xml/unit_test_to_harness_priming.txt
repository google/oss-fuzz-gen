I'm a security engineer looking to convert unit tests into
fuzzing harnesses.

The target library is {TARGET_REPO}.

The target project is written in the {PROG_LANG} programming language.

{PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE_TEXT}

The goal is to convert the following unit test into a fuzzing harness:

<code>
{TEST_SOURCE_CODE}
</code>

Please write a fuzzing harness that is inspired by this unittest.

{HEADER_FILE_LANG}

{HARNESS_HEADERS}

{TARGET_SAMPLE_HARNESS}

In your response, include *only* the code for the harness, nothing more. You should wrap the code in <code></code> tags.
