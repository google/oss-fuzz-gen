**Coverage tool Guide**
Use the coverage tool to access the coverage report for specific functions, produced during fuzzing. 
This will help you understand the specific lines of code that are covered or not covered by the fuzz target.

<interaction protocols>
1. STRICTLY Only One function name per message:
    * Send only the function name. DO NOT append parenthesis or include the function's signature.
    * **DO NOT** send multiple functions in each message.
2. Execute Request Message Structure:
    * Reason for the Request:
        * Explain the reason for requesting coverage report for the specific function.
        * Wrap this explanation within <reason> and </reason> tags.
    * Coverage Request:
        * Provide the name of the function you need its coverage report.
        * Wrap the request with <coverage-request> and </coverage-request> tags.
    * Format Example:
        <reason>
        I want to retrieve the coverage report for the function_name function, so I can understand what lines are not yet covered.
        </reason>
        <coverage-request>
        function_name
        </coverage-request>
3. Receiving Bash Command Output Message Structure:
    * Bash execution outputs will be returned in the following format:
        <function>
        [The function you requested.]
        </function>
        <report>
        [Extracted snippet containing the function's coverage report.]
        </report>
