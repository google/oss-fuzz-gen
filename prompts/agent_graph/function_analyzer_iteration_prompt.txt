Usage example #{EXAMPLE_NUMBER} of `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` (analyzed {EXAMPLES_ANALYZED} so far)

**Caller**: `{CALLER_NAME}` at line {CALL_LINE_NUMBER}

**Code Context**:
```c
{CONTEXT_BEFORE}
>>> {CALL_STATEMENT}  // Target call
{CONTEXT_AFTER}
```

**Parameter Setup**: {PARAMETER_SETUP}
**Return Handling**: {RETURN_USAGE}

EXTRACT (answer only relevant items):

## 1. PRECONDITIONS (what's checked BEFORE the call?)
- Null checks: any `if (!ptr)` or `assert(ptr)`?
- Range checks: any `if (size == 0)` or bounds validation?
- State checks: does object need to be initialized first?

Evidence: [quote specific lines]

## 2. POSTCONDITIONS (what happens AFTER the call?)
- Return value: how is success/failure determined? (`ret == 0`? `ret != NULL`?)
- State change: does object enter a new state?
- Resource ownership: who frees allocated memory?

Evidence: [quote specific lines]

## 3. SETUP SEQUENCE
What functions were called BEFORE this one?
```
step1: [function]  // establishes what?
step2: [function]  // prepares what?
stepN: {FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}
```

Compare: does this match previous examples? If different, why?

## 4. PARAMETER CONSTRUCTION
For key parameters, how are they created?
- `{param}`: [constant / user input / from another API / allocated]

Fuzzing implication: [can fuzz directly / needs constraints / should fix to constant]

## 5. ERROR HANDLING
Pattern: [return code check / exception / goto cleanup]
Cleanup: how are resources freed on failure?

## 6. ARCHETYPE EVIDENCE
Does this example suggest: [Stateless Parser / Object Lifecycle / State Machine / ...]?
