Generate a LibFuzzer fuzz target for the following function:

**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME}
**Function**: {FUNCTION_NAME}
**Signature**: {FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}
**Language**: {LANGUAGE}

**Function Analysis**:
{FUNCTION_ANALYSIS}

{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}

**Your Task**:
Write a complete, compilable fuzz target that:
1. Follows the function analysis requirements
2. Properly extracts and initializes all parameters from fuzzer input
3. Handles complex type initialization correctly
4. Includes all necessary headers with correct paths
5. Manages resources properly (allocation and cleanup)
6. Covers edge cases identified in the analysis
7. Builds successfully with the project's build system

**Implementation Guidelines**:

1. **Study Existing Code**:
   - Look at other fuzz targets in the project for header include patterns
   - Understand how the project initializes similar types
   - Follow the project's coding style and conventions

2. **Header Includes**:
   - Include headers using the same relative path style as existing fuzz targets
   - Ensure all types and functions you use are properly declared
   - Include necessary system headers (stdint.h, stddef.h, etc.)

3. **Input Extraction**:
   - For C++ targets: use FuzzedDataProvider to extract typed values
   - For C targets: manually parse the data buffer with size checks
   - Always verify sufficient input size before consumption
   - Handle variable-length data appropriately

4. **Parameter Initialization**:
   - Follow the initialization methods specified in the function analysis
   - Use constructor/initialization functions when available
   - Properly initialize structs based on analysis requirements
   - Set up any required global state before calling the target function

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle initialization failures gracefully
   - Don't crash on invalid input (unless testing for crashes)
   - Return 0 for successful fuzzer execution

6. **Cleanup**:
   - Free all allocated memory
   - Close file descriptors, network connections, etc.
   - Reset global state if the target might be called multiple times

**Output Format**:

Provide your complete solution in the following format:

<conclusion>
[Brief explanation of your implementation approach, including:
 - How you extract parameters from fuzzer input
 - Any special initialization steps required
 - Key design decisions made]
</conclusion>

<fuzz target>
[Complete, compilable fuzz target code]
</fuzz target>

<build script>
[Modified build script if needed, otherwise leave this section out]
</build script>

**Important Notes**:
- Provide the COMPLETE fuzz target code (not just snippets)
- Do not use triple backticks (```) to wrap code
- Use the XML-style tags shown above
- Ensure the code is ready to compile without modifications
