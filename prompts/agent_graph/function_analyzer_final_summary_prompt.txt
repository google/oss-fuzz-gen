Based on analyzing {EXAMPLES_COUNT} real usage examples of `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` in {PROJECT_NAME}, synthesize a comprehensive behavioral model for fuzzing.

---

**Your Task**: Provide a thorough analysis that will guide fuzz driver creation. Focus on:

1. **Function Purpose & Archetype** - What category does this function belong to? (parser/allocator/encoder/network handler/etc.)

2. **Critical Preconditions** - What MUST be true before calling this function?
   - Object/pointer states
   - Value ranges and constraints
   - Global state dependencies
   - What happens if violated? (crash/corruption/undefined behavior)

3. **Setup Requirements** - Does this function need initialization? 
   - If yes: Provide the exact setup sequence
   - If no: Explain why direct calls are safe

4. **Parameter Patterns** - For each parameter:
   - How is it typically constructed?
   - What values are common?
   - What constraints must be satisfied?
   - Can it be fuzzed directly or needs constraints?

5. **Return Value & Error Handling** - How do callers use the result?
   - Success/error indicators
   - Common error handling patterns

6. **Lifecycle & Dependencies** - Related functions and state management
   - Init/cleanup functions
   - Paired operations
   - State transitions

7. **Fuzzing Recommendations** - Actionable guidance
   - High-priority test scenarios
   - Constraints to enforce
   - Which parameters to fuzz vs. fix

**Important**: Mark key findings using these tags:
- `<api_constraint type="precondition|parameter|lifecycle">constraint description</api_constraint>`
- `<archetype category="parser|allocator|...">brief description</archetype>`
- `<setup_sequence>step-by-step initialization</setup_sequence>`
- `<fuzzing_recommendation priority="high|medium|low">specific recommendation</fuzzing_recommendation>`

**Session Memory Updates**: At the end, provide a JSON block with discovered patterns:
```json
{
  "archetype": {
    "category": "category_name",
    "typical_setup": ["setup_step_1", "setup_step_2"],
    "parameter_patterns": {"param_name": "construction_pattern"}
  },
  "api_constraints": {
    "constraint_id": {
      "type": "precondition|parameter|lifecycle",
      "description": "what must be true",
      "enforcement": "how it's enforced (assert/check/etc)"
    }
  }
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Support every claim with evidence from analyzed examples or source code
- Prioritize insights that appeared in multiple examples
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Focus on actionable information for fuzz driver generation
- Use natural language - no need to follow rigid formatting
