Analyze the target function `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` in project {PROJECT_NAME} for fuzzing.

Your goal is to identify the input and state requirements that the target function needs to:
- Execute correctly
- Achieve high coverage
- Avoid false positive crashes

False positive crashes occur when the function is called with input conditions or states that are not feasible from any of its real callers.

{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}

**Analysis Steps:**

1. **Identify Input Parameters**
   List all input parameters for the target function.

2. **Analyze Caller Patterns**
   For each input parameter, determine:
   - Is it always created/initialized using a specific function?
   - Can it be user-controlled or contain invalid values?
   - Are there clear relationships between input arguments?

3. **Identify Implicit Requirements**
   Examples include:
   - Pointer states (null pointer, function pointers, null-terminated strings)
   - Integer variable or struct member ranges
   - Number or types of variable arguments in variadic functions

4. **Specify Initialization Methods**
   For each parameter, specify how it should be initialized:
   - Using a specific function (e.g., fopen)
   - Using values from an array in the program
   - Constrained to valid values based on what callers can provide
   - Constrained based on the target function's implicit requirements
   - Using fuzz inputs directly

5. **Identify Setup Functions**
   List any functions that should be called before the target function to:
   - Set the correct state
   - Allocate or free necessary resources

6. **Compile Requirements**
   For each requirement:
   - Keep it short and precise (2 sentences max: requirement + reason)
   - Include constant values if relevant
   - For struct parameters, specify how to initialize the whole struct or each member
   - Provide a concise reason for including the requirement

**Response Format:**

Provide a clear, structured analysis with the following sections:
