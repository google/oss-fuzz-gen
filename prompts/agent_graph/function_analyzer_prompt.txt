Analyze `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` in {PROJECT_NAME} to extract the core behavioral contract for generating a correct and effective fuzz driver.

{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}

**Output Format:**

## 1. Preconditions (What MUST hold before calling)
- Object states: [required state] - Why: [crash/bug if violated] - Evidence: [cite]
- Pointers: [NULL checks needed] - Why: [usage] - Evidence: [cite]
- Values: [valid ranges] - Why: [assertion/overflow] - Evidence: [cite]
- Relationships: [inter-param constraints] - Why: [OOB/crash] - Evidence: [cite]
- Global: [initialization needed] - Why: [dependency] - Evidence: [cite]

## 2. Setup Sequence (How to establish preconditions)
**Step 1**: `func(args)` → Establishes [X], changes state [A→B] - Evidence: [cite]
**Step 2**: `func(args)` → Establishes [Y], changes state [B→C] - Evidence: [cite]
**Step N**: `{FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}` → Requires [preconditions from §1]

If direct call OK: state "No setup needed" + cite evidence.

## 3. Parameters (For EACH parameter)
### `param` (type)
- Constraint: [must be X, cannot be Y] - Why: [crash type] - Evidence: [cite]
- Construction: [how to create valid value]
- Fuzzing: [can fuzz directly / must constrain to X]

## 4. Postconditions
- Returns: [type] - Success=[values] Error=[values]
- State changes: [object: before→after]
- Cleanup: [who owns/frees resources]
- Evidence: [cite]

## 5. Crash Risks
1. [Scenario] → Crash=[type] State=[invalid] - Evidence: [cite]
2. [Invalid transition] → Why dangerous=[reason] - Evidence: [cite]

## 6. Driver Recipe (Priority order)
1. Init: [exact call to establish global state]
2. Setup: [exact calls to create valid objects]
3. Constraints: [param bounds/relationships to enforce]
4. Fuzz: [which params to fuzz, which to fix]

## 7. Summary
[1-2 sentence function purpose and key behavior]
