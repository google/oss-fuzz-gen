Fix the compilation errors in the following fuzz target:

**Language**: {LANGUAGE}

**Current Fuzz Target Code**:
```
{CURRENT_CODE}
```

**Compilation Errors**:
{BUILD_ERRORS}

{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}

**Your Task**:
Analyze the build errors and fix them while preserving the fuzzing logic and intent.

**Analysis Steps**:

1. **Understand Each Error**:
   - Read each error message carefully
   - Identify the error type (syntax, type mismatch, linker, etc.)
   - Locate the exact line and context where the error occurs

2. **Identify Root Causes**:
   - Are headers missing or included incorrectly?
     * If header information is provided above, use those EXACT paths
     * Don't guess header paths or add __has_include fallbacks
   - Are there type mismatches or casting issues?
   - Are function signatures incorrect?
   - Are symbols undefined (linker errors)?
   - Is the API being used incorrectly?

3. **Plan Your Fixes**:
   - Determine the minimal changes needed to fix each error
   - Ensure fixes don't break the fuzzing logic
   - Consider if fixes might introduce new errors
   - Check if the fixes respect function requirements

4. **Verify Your Solution**:
   - Mentally test that the fixes address all errors
   - Ensure the fuzzing logic remains intact
   - Confirm all includes are correct and complete
   - Verify type compatibility throughout

**Fix Guidelines**:
- Make only the changes necessary to fix the errors
- Preserve the original fuzzing approach and logic
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Keep the code readable and maintainable
- Follow the project's coding style
- **For header errors**: If header information is provided above, use those EXACT paths
  * Don't add conditional includes with __has_include
  * Don't guess alternative paths or capitalizations
  * The provided paths are from actual project source files
- Verify function signatures match their declarations

**Output Format**:

Provide your complete solution in the following format:

<conclusion>
[Brief explanation covering:
 - What errors were present
 - Root causes you identified
 - How you fixed each issue
 - Any important considerations]
</conclusion>

<fuzz target>
[Complete corrected fuzz target code - do NOT omit any existing code]
</fuzz target>

<build script>
[Modified build script if needed, otherwise omit this section]
</build script>

**Critical Requirements**:
- Provide the FULL corrected code (not just the changed parts)
- Do not use triple backticks (```) inside the XML tags
- Ensure all resources are properly managed
- Maintain the original fuzzing intent
- Keep changes minimal and focused
