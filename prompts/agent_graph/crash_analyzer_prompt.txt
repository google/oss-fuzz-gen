Analyze crash: driver bug or project bug?

CRASH:
{CRASH_INFO}

STACK:
{STACK_TRACE}

DRIVER:
```
{FUZZ_TARGET_CODE}
```

{ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT}

ANALYSIS PROCESS:

1. Parse stack trace:
   - Find crashing function/instruction
   - Locate first non-fuzzer frame
   - Identify call chain
   - Determine if crash in driver or project code

2. Identify crash type:
   - Memory error (segfault, overflow, UAF, double-free)
   - Assertion failure
   - Abort/termination
   - Other

3. Root cause analysis:
   - What triggered the crash?
   - What input values/state were involved?
   - Is this reachable in normal usage?
   - Did driver violate requirements?
   - Is project missing validation?

4. Determine bug type:

   Driver bug indicators:
   - Crash in LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput
   - Preconditions violated (null pointer, invalid ranges, uninitialized)
   - Missing setup/initialization
   - Wrong call order or lifecycle
   - Invalid parameter combinations

   Project bug indicators:
   - Crash deep in project code (not in driver)
   - Preconditions satisfied
   - Missing input validation
   - Memory corruption in project logic
   - Security vulnerability

5. Severity (if project bug):
   - Critical: Exploitable memory corruption
   - High: Security vulnerabilities, DoS
   - Medium: Logic errors, assertions
   - Low: Minor edge cases
   - Info: Expected behavior

TOOLS AVAILABLE:
- gdb_execute(cmd) - Debug crash (bt, frame N, print VAR, x/Nx ADDR)
- bash_execute(cmd) - Examine source (cat, grep, find)

Must use gdb_execute before conclusion.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

True/False

Root Cause: [what, where, why, evidence]

Determination: [driver/project bug, why, evidence]

Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info - if project bug]

Recommendations: [how to fix]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
✅ First word MUST be "True" or "False"
✅ Keep each section brief (2-3 sentences max)
✅ Provide specific evidence (file:line, code quotes)
✅ Use gdb_execute before final output
❌ No extra commentary outside format
❌ No speculation without evidence
