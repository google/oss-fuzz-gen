Analyze this target function and provide an initial assessment.

**Function**: {FUNCTION_SIGNATURE}

**Source Code**:
```c
{FUNCTION_SOURCE}
```

---

**Task**: Answer the following:

## 1. Function Purpose
What does this function do? [1-2 sentences]

## 2. Archetype Hypothesis
Based on the signature and source, which pattern does this likely match?
- Stateless Parser (single call, no state)
- Object Lifecycle (create→use→destroy)
- State Machine (multi-step sequence)
- Stream Processor (incremental/iterative)
- Round-trip (encode/decode)
- File-based (requires filepath)

Evidence: [Why you chose this]

## 3. Initial Observations
- Key parameters: [{name}: {purpose}]
- Return value: [what it indicates]
- Obvious preconditions: [any visible checks or requirements]
- Obvious postconditions: [what the return value means]

Keep it brief - we'll refine this analysis through usage examples next.
