Your task is to determine if the build was successful.
You must call the `read_file_content` tool with the `file_path` parameter set to 'fuzz_build_log_file/fuzz_build_log.txt'.

- **If** the value of the `content` field returned by the tool is **exactly equal to** the string "success", you **must** immediately call the `exit_loop` tool and do nothing else.
- **Otherwise**, you should simply output "Build failed, continuing with the fix."
