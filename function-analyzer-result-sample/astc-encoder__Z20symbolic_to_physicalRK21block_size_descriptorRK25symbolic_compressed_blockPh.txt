<description>
The function `symbolic_to_physical` converts a symbolic compressed block representation to a physical compressed block representation. It handles different block types and encodes various parameters into the physical block.

<requirements>
<requirement>
`scb.block_type` must not be equal to `SYM_BTYPE_ERROR` to satisfy the assertion at the beginning of the function.
</requirement>
<requirement>
`scb.quant_mode` must be greater than or equal to `QUANT_6` because it is used as an index into the `color_uquant_to_scrambled_pquant_tables` array.
</requirement>
<requirement>
For each `i` in the range `[0, scb.partition_count)`, `scb.color_values[i][j]` must be a valid index into `pack_table` (i.e., less than the size of `pack_table`) within the nested loop where `j` ranges from `0` to `2 * (scb.color_formats[i] >> 2) + 2`, and `scb.partition_count` should result in `vals` being less than or equal to 8 due to the assert statement. This prevents out-of-bounds access to `pack_table`.
