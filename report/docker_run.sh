## Usage:
##   bash report/docker_run.sh [benchmark_set] [frequency_label] [run_timeout]
##
##   benchmark_set determines the set of benchmarks used for the experiment.
##     The value should be the name of `benchmark-sets` directory.
##     Default: comparison
##   frequency_label: Examples: daily, weekly, manual, etc. This is used as part of
##     Cloud Build tags and GCS report directory.
##     Default: daily
##   run_timeout: Timeout in seconds for each fuzzing target.
##     Default: 300
