  OSS-Fuzz-Gen, an innovative open-source project developed
  by Google, automates fuzz target generation to enhance
  software security and reliability. Utilizing advanced
  techniques, including large language models (LLM),
  static code analysis, and runtime crash diagnosis,
  this project efficiently creates and optimizes fuzz targets.
  These efforts increase code coverage and identify
  vulnerabilities within open-source projects. We actively
  encourage and support collaborations with the research and
  open-source communities, offering our services at no cost.
