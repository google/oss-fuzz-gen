Selected 50 projects to test the effectiveness of headerfiles. It should be noted that we have corrected the language settings of the following projects:

**From c++ to c:**
avahi.yaml, brotli.yaml, capstone.yaml, lcms.yaml, libcoap.yaml, libfido2.yaml, libpcap.yaml, librdkafka.yaml, libtpms.yaml, libvnc.yaml, libxls.yaml, mbedtls.yaml, minizip.yaml, ndpi.yaml, njs.yaml, picotls.yaml, tidy-html5.yaml, unicorn.yaml

(In case of incorrect settings, prompt will provide a c++ fuzz target example, and LLM will mimic it by including "FuzzydDataProvider.h", causing compilation errors.)

**From c to c++:**
libjpeg-turbo.yaml, libsndfile.yaml
